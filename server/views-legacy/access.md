# littleBits Cloud Access Tokens

Access to littleBits APIs is via a simple authentication token system. You use
your access token differently when accessing the [HTTP](/api-http) or
[Streaming](/api-stream) APIs, but getting your access token is the same.

To get your access token:

1. Log in to your [Cloud Control panel](http://littlebitscloud.cc/).
1. Make sure you have at least 1 cloudBit set up [it doesnâ€™t have to be actively
connected, just having been set up].
1. Click "Settings" at the bottom right.
1. Scroll down and you will see Access Token, a long string of letters and numbers.
