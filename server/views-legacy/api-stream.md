# littleBits Cloud Websocket Streaming API Documentation

This documentation is incomplete — we are using the streaming API internally but
have not completed documentation for public use as it is still evolving. For now
we can say we are using a library called [Primus](https://github.com/primus/primus)
to power it, and that is exposes many of the same core functionalities as the
[HTTP API](/api-http).
