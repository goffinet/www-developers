# littleBits Cloud Access Tokens

To get your access token, log in to [littlebits.cc](http://littlebits.cc/login) and go to your [Cloud Control](http://littlebits.cc/cloud/control). We recommend doing this in the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/) browser.

1. Open the javascript console by typing command + option + j on mac, or ctrl + shift + j on windows.
1. You have a place in the console where you can type and execute arbitrary javascript. Type `window.cloud_credentials.access_token` and press `enter`.
1. You will now see a long string of letters and numbers surrounded by quotation marks on the next line. This is your access token.
